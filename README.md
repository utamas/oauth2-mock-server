> _OAuth 2 mock server. Intended to be used for development or testing purposes._

When developing an application that exposes or consumes APIs that are secured with an OAuth 2 authorization scheme, a mechanism for issuing access tokens is needed. Frequently, a developer needs to create custom code that fakes the creation of tokens for testing purposes, and these tokens cannot be properly verified, since there is no actual entity issuing those tokens.

The purpose of this package is to provide an easily configurable OAuth 2 server, that can be set up and teared down at will, and can be programatically run while performing automated tests.

> **Warning:** This tool is _not_ intended to be used as an actual OAuth 2 server. It lacks many features that would be required in a proper implementation.

## Development prerequisites

- [Node.js 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/)

## How to use

There are two main ways:
1. install it as dev dependency
2. install it on host and run it

### Use as dev dependency

Add it to your Node.js project as a development dependency:

```shell
npm install --save-dev oauth2-mock-server
```

Here is an example for creating and running a server instance with a single random RSA key:

```js
const { OAuth2Server } = require('oauth2-mock-server');

let server = new OAuth2Server();

// Generate a new RSA key and add it to the keystore
await server.issuer.keys.generateRSA();

// Start the server
await server.start(8080, 'localhost');
console.log('Issuer URL:', server.issuer.url); // -> http://localhost:8080

// Do some work with the server
// ...

// Stop the server
await server.stop();
```

Any number of existing JSON-formatted or PEM-encoded keys can be added to the keystore:

```js
// Add an existing JWK key to the keystore
await server.issuer.keys.add({
    kid: 'some-key',
    kty: 'RSA',
    // ...
});

// Add an existing PEM-encoded key to the keystore
const fs = require('fs');

let pemKey = fs.readFileSync('some-key.pem');
await server.issuer.keys.addPEM(pemKey, 'some-key');
```

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be built programmatically:

```js
const request = require('request');

// Build a new token
let token = server.issuer.buildToken(true);

// Call a remote API with the token
request.get(
    'https://server.example.com/api/endpoint',
    { auth: { bearer: token } },
    function callback(err, res, body) { /* ... */ }
);
```

It also provides a convenient way, through event emitters, to programmatically customize:

- The JWT access token
```js
//Modify the expiration time on next token produced
service.issuer.once('beforeSigning', (token) => {
  const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  token.payload.exp = timestamp + 400;
});
//Add the client ID to a token
const basicAuth = require('basic-auth');
service.once('beforeTokenSigning', (token, req) => {
  const credentials = basicAuth(req);
  const clientId = credentials ? credentials.name : req.body.client_id;
  token.payload.client_id = clientId;
});
```
- The token endpoint response body and status
```js
//Force the oidc service to provide an invalid_grant response on next call to the token endpoint
service.once('beforeResponse', (tokenEndpointResponse, req) => {
  tokenEndpointResponse.body = {
    error: 'invalid_grant'
  };
  tokenEndpointResponse.statusCode = 400;
});
```
- The userinfo endpoint response body and status
```js
//Force the oidc service to provide an error on next call to userinfo endpoint
service.once('beforeUserinfo', (userInfoResponse, req) => {
  userInfoResponse.body = {
    error: 'invalid_token',
    error_message: 'token is expired',
  };
  userInfoResponse.statusCode = 401;
});
```
- The revoke endpoint response body and status
```js
//Simulates a custom token revocation body
service.once('beforeRevoke', (revokeResponse, req) => {
  revokeResponse.body = {
    result: 'revoked'
  };
});
```

This is particularly useful when expecting the oidc service to behave in a specific way on one single test.

### Use from command line

The server can be run from the command line. You can either install it globally:

```shell
npm install -g oauth2-mock-server
oauth2-mock-server --help
```

or run it directly:

```shell
npx oauth2-mock-server --help
```

## Supported endpoints

### GET `/.well-known/openid-configuration`

Returns the [OpenID Provider Configuration Information](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) for the server.

### GET `/jwks`

Returns the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) of all the keys configured in the server.

### POST `/token`

Issues access tokens. Currently, this endpoint is limited to:

- No authentication
- Client Credentials grant
- Resource Owner Password Credentials grant
- Authorization code grant
- Refresh token grant

### GET `/authorize`

It simulates the user authentication. It will automatically redirect to the callback endpoint sent as parameter.
It currently supports only 'code' response_type.

### GET `/userinfo`

It provides extra userinfo claims.

### POST `/revoke`

It simulates a token revocation. This endpoint should always return 200 as stated by [RFC 7009](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009#section-2.2).

## Management API.

Management API is an optional part of OAuth2 Mocker Server CLI distribution. 

### Motivation

When writing tests, it's common practice to replace 3rd party services with mocks.
By providing a REST API for `oauth2-mock-server` it becomes language agnostic and can be
used in tests written in any language that can "talk" HTTP.

For NodeJS based projects one can just programmatically start up a server.
But, let's say, in an E2E tests stack written in Java, this would be a pain.

After spinning up a `oauth2-mock-server` on the host (or in a docker container) the REST API makes it 
easy to control the mock's behaviour from test code written in any language.

### How to use it

Simply supply any of `-m`, `--management-address <address>` or `--management-port <port>` argument when starting `oauth2-mock-server` from command line
and make standard HTTP calls to it.

Notes:
- `-m` is redundant when `--management-address <address>` or `--management-port <port>` is present,
- default management address is '0.0.0.0',
- default port is 9000.

### Supported endpoints

#### POST `/sub`

Sets username to be used as sub(ject) in both:
- signed access_token returned by `/token` endpoint and
- response returned by `/userinfo` endpoint.

Prescribed username will be used until it's explicitly cleared by making a `DELETE` call to `/sub` endpoint.

Payload:
```json
{
  "username": "janedoe",
  "email": "janedoe@some.org"
}
```

#### DELETE `/sub`

Will unset the username previously prescribed by `POST /sub`.
Once call successfully completes oauth mock server will use the default johndoe user.
